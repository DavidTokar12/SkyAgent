# SkyAgent

SkyAgent is an open source Agent framework with the goal of making open source keep up with industry as we transition into LLM Agents. 

It does not try to be a "No Code" tool; rather, it wants to lay a strong foundation in important features such as: 
- tool use 
- memory management
- multi-agent orchestration
- logging, 
- managing environment interactions 

While also staying extendable so developers can extend its functionality to best fit their needs.
